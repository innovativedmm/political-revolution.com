Welcome to the Github repository for the website of [Political Revolution](https://political-revolution.com/about). It is built upon [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) and the [Sage 8.5](https://github.com/roots/sage/releases/latest) starter theme.

Political Revolution is an all-volunteer organization which works to promote progressive values through digital activism. This website, as with all our efforts, is completely built on and reliant on contributions from people like you. Here's how to join the fight:

1. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/politicalrev/political-revolution.com/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md) to get our preconfigured developer environment set up on your computer.

2. Check out the [open issues](https://github.com/politicalrev/political-revolution.com/issues) to see what needs doing right now. Issues marked with a "help wanted" label in particular are fleshed out and just waiting to be done. When you find something you want to tackle, drop a comment and let us know you're getting started.

3. Join the PR conversation on Slack. That's where all discussion and planning for our projects take place. Go to our [volunteer page](https://political-revolution.com/volunteer/) and click the big red button to join.
